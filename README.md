# AusAutomatedDiaryQR
An automated-diary-style app

The idea is to consider whether we can augment Australian venue check-ins with an automated diary-style app like NZ's.

This would not remove the legal requirement (in some states) to use the state app - it would provide an additional mechanism by which users could be notified faster without waiting to come to the top of the manual contact-tracing queue.

The first step is successfully scanning and parsing the state QR codes; the next challenge is to match the diary entries with the public lists of exposure sites, perhaps by using [https://covid19nearme.com.au/](https://covid19nearme.com.au/).

There are some privacy issues to be considered, however - even local (on-device) recording of venues may introduce privacy problems, in the event that the user's phone comes under someone else's control.  We need to think about this.
